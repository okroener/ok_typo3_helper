### Branch `feature-typo3-9`

The `feature-typo3-9` branch of the "TYPO3 helpers" extension is specifically designed to support projects running on TYPO3 version 9. Recognizing the continued use of older TYPO3 versions in many environments, this branch ensures compatibility while still providing essential functions to integrate Microsoft Graph services. 

This branch is tailored for developers and organizations that need to work with TYPO3 9 due to infrastructure limitations, existing installations, or specific long-term support requirements. It retains the core functionalities of the extension, such as handling emails, calendar events, and contacts through the Microsoft Graph API, but adapts the implementation to function smoothly within the constraints of TYPO3 9.
