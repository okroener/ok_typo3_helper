# Typo3 Helpers

The "Typo3 helpers" extension, created by Oliver Kroener, is designed to enhance the TYPO3 content management system by providing a range of productivity utilities and helper functions for the Microsoft Graph API. This extension simplifies the integration of Microsoft 365 services, such as Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive, by offering streamlined methods to access and manage emails, calendar events, and contacts. By encapsulating complex API interactions within easy-to-use functions, "Typo3 helpers" reduces development overhead, enabling TYPO3 users to connect and leverage Microsoft’s productivity tools seamlessly.

In addition to its API integration features, the "Typo3 helpers" extension also includes a variety of productivity enhancements tailored for TYPO3 environments. These include tools for improved data handling, user management, and workflow automation, supporting both backend and frontend tasks. Designed with versatility in mind, this extension is ideal for developers looking to build robust solutions that integrate Microsoft’s ecosystem into their TYPO3 projects, helping to optimize processes and boost overall productivity.

## Branch `feature-php72-msgraph-1.0`

The `feature-php72-msgraph-1.0` branch of the "Typo3 helpers" extension is specifically tailored to accommodate projects that rely on older PHP versions, such as PHP 7.2, and the 1.0 version of the Microsoft Graph PHP SDK. Recognizing the continued use of legacy systems in many environments, this branch ensures compatibility with older setups while providing essential helper functions for integrating Microsoft Graph services. By leveraging the 1.0 SDK, this branch allows developers to maintain and extend existing TYPO3 installations that have not yet been upgraded to newer PHP versions, thereby offering a bridge between past and current technology stacks.

This branch is particularly valuable for organizations or developers who are working within constraints that require adherence to older PHP versions, either due to infrastructure limitations or long-term support agreements. The `feature-php72-msgraph-1.0` branch retains the core functionality of the extension, such as handling emails, calendar events, and contacts through Microsoft Graph API, but adapts the implementation to function smoothly within the limitations of PHP 7.2. It optimizes compatibility and stability, ensuring that essential Microsoft 365 features remain accessible and functional even in environments where newer technologies cannot yet be adopted.

By maintaining a dedicated branch for the PHP 7.2 and Microsoft Graph SDK 1.0, the "Typo3 helpers" extension demonstrates a commitment to supporting a wide range of TYPO3 users, regardless of their platform's version. It offers a practical solution for extending the life of existing projects while still providing critical productivity tools and API integrations. This branch serves as an essential resource for developers aiming to manage legacy systems effectively, ensuring that they can continue to leverage Microsoft’s powerful suite of tools without needing an immediate upgrade to newer PHP versions or SDK releases.
